        <h2>Tech</h2>
        <p>Technology we used :</p>

<p>1. Efficiency: Layer 2 handles node-to-node communication, reducing latency and complexity compared to Layer 1.</p>

<p>2. Scalability: Layer 2 supports network segmentation and isolation, making it easier to manage large networks.</p>

<p>3. Security: Features like VLANs and QoS enhance security and prioritize critical data.</p>

<p>4. Error Detection: Layer 2 protocols provide robust error detection and correction, ensuring data integrity.</p>

<p>5. Flexibility: Layer 2 allows for advanced network management and customization, optimizing performance.</p>

<p>Why you should use our technology :</p>

<p>1. Limited Scope: OTPs only enhance authentication, not addressing broader network security needs.</p>

<p>2. Scalability Issues: Managing OTPs for many users can be cumbersome and inefficient.</p>

<p>3. External Dependencies: OTPs rely on external systems like SMS or email, which can be vulnerable.</p>

<p>4. No Real-Time Monitoring: OTPs lack real-time threat detection and response capabilities.</p>

<p>5. Inadequate for Complex Networks: OTPs dont provide the granular control needed in complex environments.</p>
